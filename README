Flashrom is a utility for detecting, reading, writing, verifying and erasing
flash chips. It is often used to flash BIOS/EFI/coreboot/firmware images
in-system using a supported mainboard, but it also supports flashing of
network
cards (NICs), SATA controller cards, and other external devices which can
program flash chips.
